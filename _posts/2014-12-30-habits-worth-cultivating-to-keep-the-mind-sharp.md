I have always been interested in finding the best ways to keep the mind sharp, and a live a focused and purpuseful mind. Over the years I accumulated some habits that in my idea are essential to develop yourself and live an active and purposeful live. I do acknowledge that this is ofcourse all very personal, because you know; YMMV.

First, I think it is important to constantly expose yourself to new ideas and concepts.

## Reading
The importants and benefits of reading are undisputed. Besides reading non-fiction to expanden your knowledge, I do think it is also beneficial to read some good fiction once in while.

## Keep immersing yourself in new technologies
I recently switched to Linux, after using Windows over all my life. As I am starting to comprehend the powerfulness of the command line, I am excited to dive deeper. Exposing yourself to knew technologies, may it be a new OS, programming language, editor, keyboard layout, enables you to move out of your comfort zone and get in touch with ideas and concepts that could possible widen your horizon.

I do believe that the mind and body should be in balance.

## Lifting weights
This is one of the habits that I am cultivating for over a year know, and the one that I feel is the most fruitful. As most people live a quite sendentary lifestyle, engaging in physical activities like lifting weights to get your engine running again. As you need to be consistent with your workouts and nutrition, the attitude it creates benefits your life in more ways. I will definately write more about this in the future.

## Rising early
This one is a personal one, but I feel I am more productive and focused when I rise early. I feel more in control over my day.

## Meditating, or other mindful activities
My experiences with meditation are very limited, but I do believe that there are benefits to be reaped in here.
